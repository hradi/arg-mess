          I was thinking about maybe meeting you in this Cafe after school on
          Friday, what do you think?

        <p class="text">
          It's around 3pm for the broader cirle, then we finish things up by the
          evening. It's more of a social gathering, you would get to meet the
          people.

          I've got the meeting with Halloway. You never know how that goes. He
          wouldn't mind keeping me there til five c'clock.

          Oh, right. You've told me about this. Listen, in that case, would you
          mind meeting me today or tomorrow, so that we can discuss something
          before you get to see him?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I've got an idea but I'd rather talk to you in person for this.
