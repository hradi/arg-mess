        <h2>confused about what you think</h2>
        <p>Argon is studying his (not) beloved subject.</p>
        <p>
          "What do you mean – a supervisor?" Argon asked sharply when the woman
          finished her speech. He was sitting in a fluffy sofa, legs crossed,
          hands resting on his lap, and the woman was smiling at him with an
          innocent and irritating spark in the eye. <br />"You do realize that
          I'm not five, right? What do you think will come out of this? You
          stuck me to another person; what makes you think this will be any
          different? Whose idea was it – yours?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Does it make you feel uneasy when you're under a supervision, Argon?"
          the woman asked and Argon had to think twice to force himself into a
          more mature answer than the orginal acerbic remark that he had had on
          his mind. He watched the lady sitting opposed to him and wondered
          whether she wasn't supposed to be making notes as they spoke.
          Surprised, Argon realized that he would feel better if she was.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you thinking about, Argon?" she nudged him and he felt angry
          at her nudging. Could she ever let him be and let him think in
          solitude for as much time as he needed? He spoke to her! God knew, he
          spoke, quite a lot; he's been talking to her quite a lot, indeed. Why
          couldn't she let him be and let him think when he had his silent
          phase? He will speak when he wants to speak. She knew that, didn't
          she?

        <h2>Ranting</h2>
        <p>
          Argon keeps ranting to the people he cares about, and he keeps ranting
          about all the stuff surrounding him, but whatever he talks about, he's
          got the intention in mind to play the catch with the people he's
          talking to. Jack knows and speaks, Aspen sees and leaves him alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore Argon has probably demon or really poor De, because he can
          tell that losing people will cause suffering; possibly, he's got De,
          or Fe as a third function, as the child function if I understood
          correctly, which would mean the function that he wants to receive
          comforting through. Hence why he gets irritated with Aspen at times?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a fear of what is coming nexts; getting frustrated by the inability to see through, to see in advance, inability to control the future (Ni demon?).
        </p>
        <p>
          Aspen has Oe as a saviour, hence leaving Argon be and deal with his
          things on his own. Meaning Aspen leads with Consume, though I think
          that she is a decider. Seemingly they both have Di, or Ti as a
          saviour, and they can get along with each other pretty well because
          they work together but alone. Aspen may be more worried about and
          reluctant to the reality of Argon possibly leaving her. While Argon is
          an observer, possibly, he can see it but it isn't the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose then, that Jack leads with Oi, and possibly De. He is the
          opposite, yet not exactly. Darfrick seems to have demon identity; Jack
          seems to have identity third and pretty balanced, then. Or not?
          Anyway. Point being, Jack leads with Oi and De blast.

          <ul> Ti-Fe

          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Argon for sure has Fe, as in tribe values. He is good with tribe values, when it comes to it. Rather he is more about tribe values than he is about tribe reasons. In this sense, Argon kinda doesn't care about what the tribe thinks of his whys. He can get the job done, but he would be slightly uncomfortable with the idea of actually not having the people he cares about then after the work's been done. He, though, is quite aware of this issues, so he can think about it, talk about it and joke about it; something #Aspen would never have done for it's too untouchable and kinky for her.

        </p>
        <p>
          Argon always ingnored the realm of reality. He had pretty good long term memory, but he rarely relied on it. He would always seek more validation, more details, more proofs to back up his experience, because there was always so a lot that could have been different this time, there was always too much of what ifs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aspen kept telling him that his approach and blindness was causing half of his own problems, but he would never listen. Of course he knew what she was saying, but he was pretty aware of the reality, he was living day by day and he kept focusing on being now and here, being present and not lost in thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would sit long hours in the grass around their cottage, and he would listen to the chirping of the birds around, listen to the winds swaying the grass and watching clouds passing above his world, and he would wander off in his thoughts, he would contemplate the now and here, he would dive deep in the thought of the present, and recover an hour later, an hour or two, or he would sti like this, and then lie in the grass, beneath the branches of his lovely tree, he would sit or lie there for hours, contemplating the beauty of the tree, the beauty of the sky, the beauty of the winds and birds and grass.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if he was capable of imagining, at least, what Aspen really meant by disrupted sense of reality, and as if he was capable of imagining, at least, what it really meant to be present instead of lost deep in thoughts.
