        <p>
          This is the ultimate page for messaging talks between Argon and his
          friends. The stories are set off the time and space, or set within the
          universal time frame and cannon. Either one of the stories has a place
          to be. There is an explanation if needed.

            Jack and Darfrick are not introduced to Ms Slender yet. They may
            know each other from the universitry and mutual spheres, yet Argon
            isn't in between them yet.

        <h2>Introducing the characters</h2>
        <p>
          Argon: Tired most of the time. Argon deals with mild depressions which
          is the impression that people often get of him. He is filled with
          kindness, on the other hand, in which dissolves the typical
          disinterest and disdain towards all that is alive. His personality
          makes people wonder whether he possibly isn't just the apathetic type.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aspen: Aloof most of the time. Aspen is self-driven assistent and she
          although charismatic, she leaves the impression of untouchable cold
          stone. When one has to deal with her, it turns out, nonetheless, that
          she is very attentive and very good in solving problems for people of
          all kind. Never the typical therapist, she is much more likely to
          disapprear for a few hours, and then come back with all of your
          problems taken care of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arvey: Cheerful most of the time. Arvey is a student a little younger
          than Argon. She has trouble talking to herself, and spreads all her
          energy around. It often leaves her exhausted and miserable with no
          apparent clue and out of the blue. She can never see it coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack: working most of the time. Jack is never the last one to take the
          initiative and he never hesitatets to do when he can do, no matter the
          matter. He's focused on people and covers a broad spectrum of
          acquitances and friends, even though it can be hard for him to stick
          with someone close, since he tends to be so busy that people get
          annoyed and misunderstand his approach as disinterest. He is a great
          coworker, yet he tends to miss what the people around him really
          crave, just as much as he tends to undervalue what he really craves
          himself. Just get the job done first, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver: out with people most of the time. Oliver is one of the closest
          to Arvey, especially since he is never too clingy, never too present,
          and never really gets upset with anyone around. He is popular, hence,
          because he loves working with people, yet is never too carried away
          like Jack is. He likes things the way they are, though, which may
          frustrate those often around him. Improve, embellish and delve deep
          into an issues, as long as we can stick to it for as long as we'd
          like: a year at least, shall we?

        <p>
          Argon is lying in the grass beneath his beloved tree, phone firmly
          gripped in hands. Shall he text her?
        </p>
        <div class="messages">
          <p class="arg-out">Hey.</p>
          <p class="arg-out">
            I don't know what to say. It's been so long. You remember me?
          </p>

          He waited, then. He thought he would wait a few hours, a day maybe,
          maybe she won't reply at all. It was an old messaging app, after all,
          and he had doubts about her still having it. Why would she, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't take half the time he thought it would. She replied within a
          few minutes.
        </p>
        <div class="messages">
          <p class="asp-inc">
            No such blessing over here. I see you still have got this app.
            What's going on?
          </p>
          <p class="arg-out">
            I'm coming back to the uni. I was wondering if you were still there?
          </p>
          <p class="asp-inc">I am. Will I get to see you?</p>
          <p class="arg-out">I was about to ask you that.</p>
          <p class="asp-inc">
            Well, you weren't exactly keen to seeing me at all, the last time we
            spoke.
          </p>
          <p class="arg-out">
            That's why I'm asking. I don't think I was making a mistake back
            then, but I'm sorry for what we've lost. I mean, I think that I'm
            sorry because of what I did to you. I think I'd understand if you
            were mad.
          </p>
          <p class="asp-inc">
            Then you understand that I was mad but that I don't really care at
            all now.
          </p>

          <p class="asp-inc">
            I mean, I don't care about what's happened, you know. You had
            reasons, I can respect that. I could see them and I could tell how
            stupid they were back then, already. But you explained yourself,
            that's all that matters to me. But you know that, so why asking?
          </p>
          <p class="arg-out">Uh. Come on. You know why.</p>
          <p class="asp-inc">
            Haha, so no specific motives again? You really haven't changed, have
            you?
          </p>
          <p class="arg-out">
            So you just about to mock me now. You haven't changed either, have
            you?
          </p>
