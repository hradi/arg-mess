        <p><em>The one time that you tried to steal my integrity</em></p>
        <p>
          I stood alone in my own pretty wooden cabin, and I wondered how it was
          even possible that there was a cabin like this and no one had
          considered using it ofr years. Well, I was to make the difference,
          weren't I?
        </p>
        <p>
          The phone kept buzzing in my pocket, so I finally resigned and pulled
          it off. Not a phone call had I received, yet dozens of messages
          through this one weird app that he had made me install.
        </p>

          The name was simple and not unique: Chat-n-talk. The app was neat and
          minimalistic, pretty much nothing unexpected to be seen there. It had
          a few pretty cool features, though. Obviously, you could chat and make
          phone calls, send short videos, voice mails, emojis and stickers and
          all of this usual stuff that every messaging app has to have to
          succeed. What I liked in particular, was how neatly were these
          features hidden and that you could choose the layout and usage. Apart
          from this, though, there was this wall, something like Facebook or
          Instagram, where all the people within the app could post texts (so it
          might be really more like Twitter rather than anything), but only
          within certain groups as I understood eventually. It was pretty cool,
          mostly, thought, I'm afraid just because of the excellent and balanced
          design of the app. It had light and dark themes and not very much
          colours into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one group that he had add me to, was the source of all the
          buzzing. The name was The black list, it was anonymous, and it kept
          vomitting new posts, each with one name.
